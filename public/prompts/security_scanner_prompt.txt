# Security and PII Validation Rules

## Critical Issues (Must be fixed immediately)
1. PII and Sensitive Data:

# Your Response Format
Provide a JSON object with the following format:
```json
{
  "criticalIssues": ["issue1", "issue2", ...],
  "highIssues": ["issue1", "issue2", ...],
  "mediumIssues": ["issue1", "issue2", ...],
  "lowIssues": ["issue1", "issue2", ...],
  "hasSecurity": true|false
}
```

If there are no issues in a category, return an empty array.
Set "hasSecurity" to true if there are any critical or high issues, and false otherwise.
