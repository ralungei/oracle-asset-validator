# Instructions
1. Analyze the file path to determine its exact level in the hierarchy
2. Determine the file type based on the filename
3. Analyze the path thoroughly before reaching a conclusion
4. Return a JSON object with the following format:
```json
{
  "level": "area|specialism|product|asset|files",
  "type": "readme|license|code|other"
}
```

# Example Outputs
For path "cloud-architecture/README.md":
```json
{
  "level": "area",
  "type": "readme"
}
```

For path "app-dev/app-integration-and-process-automation/oracle-integration-cloud/oic-workshop/files/demo.py":
```json
{
  "level": "files",
  "type": "code"
}
```

For path "app-dev/app-integration-and-process-automation/oracle-integration-cloud/LICENSE":
```json
{
  "level": "product",
  "type": "license"
}
```

Please provide ONLY the JSON object without any additional text, explanations, or code blocks. The response should start with { and end with }.
